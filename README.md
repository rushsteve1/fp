# Go Functional Programming

I was inspired by @fossker's wonderful talk at Doomconf 2022H2 and his
[Common Lisp Transducers](https://codeberg.org/fosskers/cl-transducers#headline-39)
package and documentation

But this is a different approach that aims to build upon Go's existing standard
library to introduce transducers in a simple way alongside a lot of other
FP features that I've had written in different places

> **NOTE**: This library requires support for generic type aliases
